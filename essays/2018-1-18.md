   I have become very interested in software engineering lately.  Java was not my favorite language and Javascript seems much more fun and easy since it reminds of back in elementary school when I was building webpages.  I hope to be able to build a decent webpage by the end of the semester and be proficient in SQL and Python through the semester.
	 Iâ€™m also very interested in computer security and being able to reverse engineer.  I want to improve my cryptography and be able to write secure software that I will not be unbreakable.  I will continue to improve my programming this semester because I want to get into A.I and A.G.I. eventually.
	I really love algorithms and the math side of programming.  I will learn how to incorporate calculus and powerful mathematical formulas into my code to reach new heights hopefully.  My main goal is to continue to practice coding daily and challenge myself with new problems.  Hopefully, the problems will become more difficult.
